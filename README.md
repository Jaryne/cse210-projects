# cse210-ww-student-template
Hello! I'm here for another semester. I'll be learning about C# and more. You know my name, see you in 7 weeks. 

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.
